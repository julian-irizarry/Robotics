## **1.** [PID/PD Controller for a Single Arm Robot](https://julian-irizarry.github.io/Robotics/PID)

This project compared PID and PD controllers with how they affected moving a simulated arm to a desired point. The project was done in MATLAB. The only function that was used was ODE45 to solve the differential equation for the controllers.

## **2.** [Inverse Kinematics of a Two-Joint Arm to Follow a User Defined Path](https://julian-irizarry.github.io/Robotics/kinematics)

A program written in MATLAB that has a user click to create points to create a path for a simulated arm. The points are interpolated into a smooth curve that the arm navigates using inverse kinematics. No additional packages were used for the animation of the arm or the calculations of the path of the arm.
